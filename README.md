# Project Description: Building a Conversational Chatbot with Langchain and OpenAI API

# Introduction:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my internship project with Pearl Thoughts! In this project, I have developed a sophisticated chatbot using the Streamlit app framework, Langchain, and the OpenAI API. The chatbot is designed to provide an interactive and conversational experience, making use of cutting-edge language models to enhance user interactions.

# Project Structure:
The app is built on the Streamlit platform, offering a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. The underlying model architecture is based on Langchain, a powerful framework for constructing Language Model (LM) systems. Leveraging the capabilities of Langchain, the project incorporates components such as RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for text splitting, OpenAIEmbeddings for embedding, FAISS for vector storage, and ConversationalRetrievalChain for managing conversational context.

# OpenAI API Integration:
To empower the chatbot with advanced language understanding and generation, the OpenAI API is seamlessly integrated into the project. This integration enables the chatbot to make dynamic API calls, tapping into the extensive capabilities of OpenAI's language models.

# Model Architecture:
The project utilizes Langchain's ConversationalRetrievalChain, which efficiently manages conversational context and enhances the flow of interactions. The OpenAI language model (LLM) plays a crucial role in providing context-aware responses and generating human-like text.

# Streamlit Extras:
The inclusion of Streamlit extras, such as the 'add_vertical_space' module, enhances the visual appeal and user experience of the chatbot interface. These additions contribute to the overall usability of the application.

# Collaboration with Pearl Thoughts:
I am immensely thankful to Pearl Thoughts for providing this internship opportunity, allowing me to delve into the realms of natural language processing and conversational AI. This collaboration has been instrumental in the development of a robust and engaging chatbot.
