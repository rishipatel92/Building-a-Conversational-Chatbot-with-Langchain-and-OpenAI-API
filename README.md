Project Description: Building a Conversational Chatbot with Langchain and OpenAI API
Introduction:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my internship project with Pearl Thoughts! In this project, I have developed a sophisticated chatbot using the Streamlit app framework, Langchain, and the OpenAI API. The chatbot is designed to provide an interactive and conversational experience, making use of cutting-edge language models to enhance user interactions.

Project Structure:
The app is built on the Streamlit platform, offering a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. The underlying model architecture is based on Langchain, a powerful framework for constructing Language Model (LM) systems. Leveraging the capabilities of Langchain, the project incorporates components such as RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for text splitting, OpenAIEmbeddings for embedding, FAISS for vector storage, and ConversationalRetrievalChain for managing conversational context.

OpenAI API Integration:
To empower the chatbot with advanced language understanding and generation, the OpenAI API is seamlessly integrated into the project. This integration enables the chatbot to make dynamic API calls, tapping into the extensive capabilities of OpenAI's language models.
